# TV antenna mount
The aim of this project is to create a structure that will allow the TV antenna to be mounted using zip ties, with the whole structure being attached to the TV via screws in VESA holes.

## 3D printing information
3D printing information provides a basic overview of the parameters involved in printing all parts of a particular project. The data on printing time and material consumption are based on slicer-generated data and do not correspond to actual values that would include, for example, the time required for calibration, heating and other processes. These values should therefore be considered as indicative only.

- Number of parts to print: 3 pieces
