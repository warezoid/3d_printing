## 3D printing information
3D printing information provides a basic overview of the parameters involved in printing all parts of a particular project. The data on printing time and material consumption are based on slicer-generated data and do not correspond to actual values that would include, for example, the time required for calibration, heating and other processes. These values should therefore be considered as indicative only.

- Number of parts to print: 1 piece
