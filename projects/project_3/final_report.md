## 3D printing information
3D printing information provides a basic overview of the parameters involved in printing all parts of a particular project. The data on printing time and material consumption are based on slicer-generated data and do not correspond to actual values that would include, for example, the time required for calibration, heating and other processes. These values should therefore be considered as indicative only.

- Number of parts to print: 1 piece

## Drawings and 3D modelling
The sponge holder consists of two horizontal platforms placed at different heights. Each platform has a groove for catching excess water. The platforms are arranged in a stepped shape.  The walls of the step are perforated with a hexagonal grid, which ensures material saving, light weight, strength and attractive appearance. The whole structure forms one solid unit.

Below you can find a technical drawing of the sponge holder.

**3D models**

<br>

The 3D models of the **sponge holder** are available in FreeCAD format for possible modifications or in STL format, ready for direct 3D printing. Links can be found below:

- FreeCAD format: [sponge_holder.FCStd](./3d/freecad/sponge_holder.FCStd)
- STL: [sponge_holder.stl](./3d/stl/sponge_holder.stl)


**Final part**
