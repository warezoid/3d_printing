# Plant marker
The goal of this project is to create a simple plant marker.

<br>

**Warning**

The product is made of PLA plastic, which, although it comes from renewable sources, is still plastic and therefore does not belong in the wild. I recommend using this project with respect for the environment - ideally in your own garden or in someone else's garden with the owner's permission.

If the product runs out of life, try to reuse it or recycle it properly.

## 3D printing information
3D printing information provides a basic overview of the parameters involved in printing all parts of a particular project. The data on printing time and material consumption are based on slicer-generated data and do not correspond to actual values that would include, for example, the time required for calibration, heating and other processes. These values should therefore be considered as indicative only.

- Number of parts to print: 1 piece
