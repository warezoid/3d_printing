# 3D printing
The 3D Printing Repository brings together my projects focused on 3D printing, engineering, DIY and other areas that are not complex enough to have their own repositories.

- **Use case**
    - The projects contain my own 3D models, drawings, technical descriptions and calculations that can be used for educational purposes or for projects of various types.

- **Disclaimer**
    - I'm not a professional yet. Therefore, I cannot guarantee the accuracy of the calculations or the compliance of the technical documentation with the applicable standards. Some projects may involve working with electricity, so it is essential that you carry out all work at your own risk and verify the accuracy of the information.

## Tools
I use [FreeCAD](https://www.freecad.org/) for modelling, drawing and report creation. I print on [Creality K1 Max](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-k1-max-3d-printer) printer from [Creality](https://www.creality.com/) in combination with [Creality Print](https://www.creality.com/pages/download-software) slicing program. The filament used may vary for each project, so it is listed separately for each project. If other tools were used in the project, they are listed in the resources section of the respective project.



## Project overview
The [Project Overview](#project-overview) section is used to better navigate between projects and provides a comprehensive list of all projects.
